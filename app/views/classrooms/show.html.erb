Classroom Info
<%= render partial: "classroom", locals: {classroom: @classroom} %>

We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: @classroom.oldest_student} %>

<!-- Why is this not explicitly stated in the readme? -->
<% @classroom.students.each do |student| %>
  <%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student:student} %>
<%end%>
