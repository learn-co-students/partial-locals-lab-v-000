Classroom Info
<%= render partial: 'classroom', locals: {classroom: @classroom} %>

<ul>
  <% @classroom.students.each do |student| %>
    <li> <%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: student} %>
  <% end %>
</ul>

We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: @classroom.oldest_student}  %>
