<%= render partial: 'classroom', locals: {classroom: @classroom} %>

We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: @classroom.oldest_student} %>

<h2>Class Students</h2>
<%@classroom.students.each do |student_instance| %>
	<%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: student_instance} %>
<%end%>
