Classroom Info
<%= render 'classroom' %> 

Students 
<%= @classroom.students.each do |stu| %> 
	<%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: stu  } %>
<% end %>

We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: @classroom.oldest_student }%>
