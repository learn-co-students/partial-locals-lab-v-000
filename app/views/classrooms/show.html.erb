Classroom Info


<%=render partial: "classroom", locals: {classroom: @classroom} %>

We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<%# render 'students/student' %>
<% @classroom.students.each do |student| %>
<%= render partial: "students/student", locals: {student: student} %>
<% end %>

<%# render partial: "students/student", collection: @classroom.students %>
