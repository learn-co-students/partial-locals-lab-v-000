Classroom Info

<%= render 'classroom' %>


<h1>Students</h1>


<%@classroom.students.each do |student| %>
<%binding.pry%>
  <%= render partial: "students/student", locals: {student: student} %>

<%end%>


We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<%@student = @classroom.students[0]%>
<%= render 'students/student' %>
