We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<%= render partial: 'classroom', locals: { classroom: @classroom }%>

 <% @classroom.students.each do |student|%>
  <%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: { student: student }%>
 <%end%>

# # they also want to add some search functionality so that a user can
# search for a student by name. It's okay if other students with similar names are
# returned in the search results.
