Classroom Info
<p>
<%= render partial: "classrooms", locals: {classroom: @classroom} %>

We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<% @students.each do |student| %>
<%= render partial: "students/student", locals: {student: student} %>
<% end %>
<!--render :template => "classrooms/show.html.erb"-->
