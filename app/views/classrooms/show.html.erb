Classroom Info
<p>
<%= @classroom.course_name %>
<%= @classroom.semester %>
<% @classroom.students.each do |student| %>
  <%= student.name %>
<% end %>
</p>

We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: @student = @classroom.oldest_student} %>
