<%= render partial: 'classroom', locals: {classroom: @classroom} %>

We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: @classroom.oldest_student} %>


<!-- Display students: --> 
<% @classroom.students.each do |ind_student| %>
<%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: ind_student} %>
<% end %>
