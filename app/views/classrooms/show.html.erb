Classroom Info

<%= render partial: "classroom", locals: {classroom: @classroom} %>


We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<%if @student%>
  <%= render partial: "students/student", locals: {student: @student} %>
<%end%>
Other Students: <br>
<% @classroom.students.each do |student| %>
  <%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: student} %>
<% end %>
