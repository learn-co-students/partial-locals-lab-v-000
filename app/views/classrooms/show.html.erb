Classroom Info
<%= render partial: 'classroom', locals: {classroom: @classroom}%>

We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
 <% Classroom.all.each do |classe| %>
   <% classe.students.each do |student|%>
     <%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: student} %>
   <% end %>
 <% end %>
