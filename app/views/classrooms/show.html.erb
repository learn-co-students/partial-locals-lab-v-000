Classroom Info
<%= render partial: "classroom", locals: {classroom: @classroom} %>

We now want to call all students in the class:
<% if @classroom.students %>
  <% @classroom.students.each do |student| %>
  <% binding.pry %>
  <%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: student} %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
