issue summary

-i am supposed to give a search function, where the user can input a potentially incomplete string and be presented with a full list of all students whose names include that string. So if given 'rob', they would get "Robert", "Roberta" and anyone else, but none others.

-i'm not sure 1 how to take that string from the user, but also 2 how to pass it to the search function.
